       <h1>Knowing which Block to Customize</h1>

        <p>In this example, the customized fragment name is <span>integer_widget</span> because you want to override
           the HTML <span>widget</span> for all <span>integer</span> field types. If you need to customize <span>textarea</span> fields,
           you would customize <span>textarea_widget</span>.</p>

        <p>As you can see, the fragment name is a combination of the field type and which part of the field is being rendered
           (e.g. <span>widget, label, errors,</span> row). As such, to customize how errors are rendered for just input <span>text</span> fields,
            you should customize the <span>text_errors</span> fragment.</p>

        <p>More commonly, however, you'll want to customize how errors are displayed across all fields.
		   You can do this by customizing the <span>form_errors</span> fragment. This takes advantage of field type inheritance.
		   Specifically, since the <span>text</span> type extends from the <span>form</span> type, the Form component will first look for the type-specific fragment
		   (e.g. <span>text_errors</span>) before falling back to its parent fragment name if it doesn't exist (e.g. <span>form_errors</span>).</p>
